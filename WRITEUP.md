# Evaluation of CitiBike Redistribution Policies

# 1. Introduction

CitiBike is New York City's dock-based bike share program. Dock-based programs, CitiBike included, face serious challenges related to bike distribution: in the morning, bikes tend to migrate from residential to commerical areas, leading to a surplus of bikes in commerical areas and a scarcity of bikes inresidential areas. This phenomenon is clearly visible in the following animation, which shows the fraction of docks that are filled at each docking station in NYC, at the beginning of each hour (EST) on May 3rd, 2018. Green dots represent docking stations that have many bikes available, while red dots represent stations that have very few bikes available.

Looking at the animation you'll notice that, during business hours, most stations in commerical areas (eg. Financial District, Midtown, Downtown Brooklyn) are nearly or completely full, while most stations in some residential areas (eg. Upper East Side, Upper West Side, East Village, parts of Brooklyn) are nearly or completely empty. The opposite is true during other parts of the day. These shifts in bike distribution make it frustrating for some customers to find bikes when they begin their trips and find open spots for bikes when they finish their trips, and might be discouraging people from participating in the CitiBike program. 

CitiBike is currently trying to address this issue through both [Valet stations and bike redistribution](https://help.citibikenyc.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007197887-Redistribution). CitiBike sends employees to some of the businest stations to provide or collect excess bikes, as necessary ("Valet" service). CitiBike also employs people to transport bikes from full stations to empty stations using "non-motorized bike trains" (not sure what those are). Finally, CitiBike runs a program called "[Bike Angels](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/12/11/675828915/citi-bike-s-better-angels)," in which CitiBike members can redeem prizes (discounts, free passes, gift cards) for riding bikes from full stations to empty stations. 

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a lot of information on how sucessful these strategies have been. Out of curiosity, I decided download some publically available CitiBike data to figure this out myself.
