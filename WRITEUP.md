# Evaluation of CitiBike Redistribution Policies

# 1. Introduction

CitiBike is New York City's dock-based bike share program. Dock-based programs, CitiBike included, face serious challenges related to bike distribution: in the morning, bikes tend to migrate from residential to commerical areas, leading to a surplus of bikes in commerical areas and a scarcity of bikes inresidential areas. This phenomenon is clearly visible in the following animation, which shows the fraction of docks that are filled at each docking station in NYC, at the beginning of each hour (EST) on May 3rd, 2018. Green dots represent docking stations that have many bikes available, while red dots represent stations that have very few bikes available.

If you stare at the gif for long enough, you'll notice that most stations in commerical areas (eg. Financial District, Midtown, Downtown Brooklyn) are nearly or completely full, while most stations in some residential areas (eg. Upper East Side, Upper West Side, East Village, parts of Brooklyn) are nearly or completely empty during work hours. The opposite is true during the evening, night, and early morning. The migration of bikes makes it difficult for some commuters to find a free bike when they leave home, and to find an open spot for their bike once they reach their workplace. This is frustrating, and could be discouraging users from participating in the CitiBike program. 

CitiBike is currently trying to address this issue through [Valet stations and bike redistribution](https://help.citibikenyc.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007197887-Redistribution). At a bike stations that are routlinely full/empty, you might find CitiBike employees who provide extra bikes when the station is empty and collect bikes when the station is full. Employees also transport bikes from full stations to empty stations using "non-motorized bike trains" (whatever those are). Finally, CitiBike has a program called "Bike Angels," in which CitiBike members can redeem prizes (discounts, free passes, gift cards) for riding bikes from full stations to empty stations. 

I couldn't find much information on these strategies' success, so I decided to evaluate them myself using publically available CitiBike data.
